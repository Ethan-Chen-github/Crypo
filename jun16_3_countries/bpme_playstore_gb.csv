Other than that the app is slow to initialise at the pump so unless there was a big queue at the till I doubt I'll use the app again. [Edit] Still intent on getting the £10 Amex offer I tried again and this time set the required amount at £31. The pump slowed the dispense rate towards the end and stopped at exactly £30. This under-dispensing is supposedly to stop more than requested being dispensed but if it can consistently stop at exactly £1 less than requested why can't it stop at exactly the amount requested??,26,1,2018-12-20 21:15:30,"Hi Mick.

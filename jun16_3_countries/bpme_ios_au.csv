66,2017-12-19 05:02:17,Andy C Photography,True,Worst experience ever,"After using the app for the first time, I can safely say that I won’t be using it again. After sitting in my car, waiting for the app to find my location and then selecting the pump number, it took about another minute before the pump was actually unlocked and the app to tell to commence filling up my car. Once I had finished refuelling, I return the fuel hose and jumped into my car. Here the screen was still stuck on a loading screen. Waiting for the next screen to pop up confirming that the transaction had been paid for. This screen took another couple minutes just sitting there. So I sat in my car again. Not wanting to drive away not paying for fuel. Frustrated, I went into the shop and told the attendant my issue, that I’m not sure if I’ve paid yet and that if he can confirm. The response I was greeted with was deplorable. Absolutely rude. “You’re using the app. I don’t know why you came in for. You’re wasting your time and my time now. Just go”. Angrily, I just left immediately. Disgusted. Only till I drove down the road away from the fuel station, the screen changed and showed a payment confirmation screen.

But the saddest part is they charged me extra for fuelling up when the card was decline (not my fault but they guy behind the counter pressed 95 instead of 98). So i was fuelling up at bp summer hill, so i started the apps and wait for the apps to load (which is slow) and followed their instruction by choosing the station and pump number. I then proceed to fill up my car and wait till it approve. However, it got declined. So i went in and ask the gentleman behind the counter. He claimed that i paid which i went to my banking apps and my account still hasnt been deducted in full. However they deduct $1 off me (till this day i dont know whats that for. And no this is not the first time im using it). So the person behind the counter was confused and he called his manager and they were talking in their language which i couldnt understand and he hung up and told me to just drive and BP will contact me so i being paranoid i told him to take my mobile number just incase. He admitted that he pressed a wrong fuel type prior of me fuelling up. I left and couple hours later, i received a message from BP to pay my account via a link but when i checked they charge me another $3 for a mistake that i didnt even do. I dont think this is right i mean $4 dollar to use an app that supposedly make your life easier. Sorry if i sound like a cheapskate but i just fuelled up for 20 dollar so it doesnt really make sense.

There is a lot of anxious waiting when using this app:. - waiting to login and be able to select a pump. - once the pump is selected, there is a longer waiting time for the pump to be “unlocked”. - after filling up, the longest wait was for the transaction to take place, which is the worst wait of all since 1) there is no other button/option to press so you’re just hoping your payment goes through, and 2) people are still unused to just getting straight into their cars without paying for petrol first. Similar to my initial sentiment, I would prefer to just pay for petrol the old-fashioned way than to use this app, unless I choose to remain in the car with the kids, eg thunderstorms. On a hot day I would probably take them out with me rather than to sit in the car that I cannot run the ignition on as I’ll be using the phone. Having said this, I’ll still keep an eye for future improvements as it does have potential. Thank you. ##########. Original review:. I, too, had high hopes for this app as it would potentially allow me to pay for petrol without having to take my kids out of the car, but testing it out by myself I could not get it to work; specifically it would give me a “technical error” when selecting a pump and ask me to try again, but it never worked so I ended up walking in to pay. I would like to echo other people’s experiences that it just takes too long with the engine off before you can even fill up (when it works, that is) so, until that is remediated, again I would not be considering using this with children in the car.

That was without any search filters applied too.  I initially had filters to look for BPme-enabled stations & BP Rewards stations but my stations of interest did not appear on map.  I removed the filters and they still did not display.  App REQUIRES device’s ‘Location Services’ to be ON in order to complete registration which I do not like- I would prefer to be able to register without Location Services, and then just manually enter a town name, or only activate Location Services manually for search if I was looking for a servo in an unfamiliar region where I didn’t know town name/s to enter.  I would prefer the Store Finder map to display ALL stations and just be able to zoom in to the area I was in, rather than having to enter town names or activate Location Services.

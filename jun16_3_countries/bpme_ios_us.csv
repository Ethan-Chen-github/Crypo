1,2019-01-06 03:18:13,BoatYardDweller,False,Rather Worthless,This app made lots of promises in the introductory email however it’s failed to fulfill any of them. I was promised a $.25 bonus for trying the app but when I attempted to use it at the station in my neighborhood I learned that it did not work there. In fact the closest station was 35 miles away so I made the trek only to pay an additional $.30 per gallon above my local stations price. At least I was able to experience the potential convenience the app could offer. After my purchase I received an email congratulating me on using the app and earning the $.25 bonus. When I didn’t see the bonus reflected in my balance I contacted customer support. After 4 unanswered inquiries I was disappointed to learn that BP decided to cancel the bonus they congratulated me for earning because they deemed my purchase insufficient to remit the bonus. Sadly I will no longer purchase my fuel at BP after I use my rewards balance and instead of sharing the benefits of the app’s safety (the BP station I frequent at the entrance to my community was recently found to have card readers that steal your credit card info which made me eager to share the app as an option at my next community meeting) and convenience I’ll be sharing my dissatisfaction with my network.

2,2019-03-04 17:35:39,Jay4money29,False,It’s okay but flawed,The ideal of the app is great! I can pull up to the pump and activate it with just my phone. However I’ve been experiencing trouble using it. The very first time worked fine.  Is when I open the app the debit card I registered is missing and I can no longer add debit or credit cards. You will also get charged the credit price which is really unfortunate steering you away from using the app. However since my debit card was linked to my rewards account. Every time I use this debit card the pump ask me do I want to apply my rewards and my rewards account is forever associated with my debit card so I still get my rewards and the debit price using my card.

8,2019-06-04 20:27:07,Loco_Ese,False,Great overall,The app is intuitive enough to use once its setup.  The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the start up of the app (once I’m at the BP station of my choice) takes noticeably longer to load than any of the other gas apps I use.  Maybe look at using async methods within the webservice application and have certain aspects of the app to load one at a time while the rest of the information (the cents off) loads.  When I first started using the app I thought it froze up since the UX just shows a gas station image for approx 15-20 seconds with no perceived activity by the app; maybe have a BP waiting/loading indicator.  Other than that I love the convenience of not having to use my BP rewards card and then use my credit card for a gas transaction.

Also it helps to tell you where the nearest BP pump is, especially when you’re somewhere you’re not familiar with. And lastly, it’s great not having to pull out my wallet! I gas up a lot in New Jersey, where you can’t pump your own gas.

10,2019-06-04 21:10:38,AngerpodJ,False,Pretty good,The app is a great concept that is executed pretty well. The only reason I don’t give it five stars is the fact that occasionally he can’t seem to find my location.

11,2019-06-05 11:09:18,Lajacobs,False,Works really well,"Overall, I love using this app because I don’t have to swipe a card at the pump and worry about checking for skimmers on the card reader. When I travel, I occasionally end up “losing” my reward because of paying the credit price at a station that charges different rates based on how you pay, which irritates me. The one problem I’ve had with the app itself is accidentally using the wrong card due to it defaulting to the last one you used. I don’t always use the same card, and it doesn’t prompt you to choose a card for the current transaction. I’ve done this twice, so I just try to be more mindful to check it.

17,2019-10-13 23:53:01,kmslaughter,False,Can’t use it.,I downloaded the app right as the rewards quit. I used the normal rewards every week with my job causing me to travel a lot. Now I go to use this new app and get it all set up. I went to a local bp station and went to log in. I had no issues logging in. Once I logged in and proceeded to pay it told me I wasn’t at a bp station. The bp station was 100 yards down the road. So I got out and paid for the gas. Thru the reader and didn’t get a discount. Then out of curiosity I went down the road to the “gas station” location and found it to be a rev park with no gas station. The gas station was put in the system in the wrong area. So now it wants me to pay for my gas down the road from the gas station pick a pump and hope it’s open. Or let someone steal my gas. My company request we use Exxon since we get a discount with them but with the rewards I could get one with bp but now the gas card that I use doesn’t have 16 digits and it won’t let me load it I have to go to Exxon.

52,2021-03-20 20:00:07,htmn15,False,Unable to use the App,I needed gas so went to my nearest bp gas station. I was unable to open the app-just an error message. I tried logging back into my account and was eventually locked out because of the technical difficulties with the app and I was unable to log back in for 15 minutes. I ended up having to reset my password. So I waited on the side of the road for 15 minutes to pass by but still unable to log into my account using the app. 15 minutes turned to 30 minutes and then an hour and still cannot log into the app-just getting an error message.

It comes back with a notice that they are having technical difficulties, again and again.  A week later...I again arrived at the pump and got the same error message that they were having technical difficulties. I called tech support and waited and waited for about 10 minutes getting constant messages that somebody would be with me shortly and again and again.

I was going to ride past the BP station, so I called tech support before I got there.

54,2021-04-02 16:36:54,Jisto1,False,Way too poorly made,"When the app works, it’s nice to sometimes save some money on gas, but more often than not, the app has issues. Between the pump not pumping after being unlocked, and the app thinking you’re not at a BP when you are, more often than not, this app is just a letdown. The fact that on their own map, their locations aren’t accurate, and there’s no way to bypass the location check to apply your rewards has made me lose faith in BPs ability to provide even basic conveniences.

55,2021-04-14 23:40:13,DCAguy83,False,Great (when it works) but zero customer support,"The app is great when it works, incentivizing payment with the app. I consider BP a premium product and the ability to pay without leaving my car seems like a premium idea. Unfortunately at several stations I get a “technical issues” error and can’t pay with the app. You get a discount using a linked card, but it’s less than half the discount of using a linked card through the app (5c versus 11c). There’s zero customer support for the app. Emails say you get a reply in 12 business hours, but my email from this weekend hasn’t been answered three full business days later.

56,2021-04-23 20:20:54,BH Atlanta,False,Clunky and Inefficient UX,"The app is a bit clunky and inefficient. It should be clearer where to go to locate your station and fuel, especially in larger cities where you have multiple BP locations on the map in a close proximity to each other and/or are located on the same street.  Part of the problem is that the stations should be better set up to accommodate app usage by clearly displaying the pump number and address while you’re sitting in your car — otherwise, why stand at a pump to work through each step of the app when you can just quickly swipe your card?  It would also be helpful to have clear confirmation of each step in the process to guide you through each step. The 5 cent/gallon discount is especially insignificant when it requires a minimum amount of spend each month - especially in the era of COVID when people are driving less and using less gas.",2,"{'id': 22468819, 'body': 'Hi there, thanks for taking the time to share your valuable feedback.

57,2021-05-04 13:26:58,Overzeetop,True,I’d rather eat glass than set up this app again,"Possibly the singular worst setup experience I’ve ever had on iOS. The app link to email doesn’t work, the app link from email back doesn’t work. The password entry screen has no way to reload if it freezes. There is no paste functionality in the CC entry screen. I guarantee this was not worth the $10 credit I was offered to sign in. I can only hope the usage experience is better. If it is, I’ll add star(s) back. Update - used the app for the first time. Had to drive to two different pumps to make it work as the first pump timed out (hung in the ""waiting"" mode while trying to select a grade) and was unusable. Second pump worked, luckily the station was empty or the failure would have been really annoying and awkward.

58,2021-05-14 03:25:54,X-Rover,False,«Pay for fuel” function is not reliable,"It’s nice designed app, but I would avoid using “Pay for fuel” function. I have paid using this function today at the pump. The pump got activated and it charged me $100 right away using Apply Pay. I did not pump any fuel yet, so hoped it some kind of crazy high pre-authorization and it will adjust the balance. Then the pump was just not responding to start fueling process, allowing me to select only a fuel grade and nothing else. The cancel button got grayed out in the app, so I was not able to cancel it, but I was not able to get any fuel either. I called gas station workers and they were not able to help me either, since that transaction was initiated using that app and they din’t have a control over it. Wrokers agree to block that pump, so no one else can use that pre-authorized pending transaction and gave me a 800 BP number to call to find out  how to refund $100 charge. So, instead of spending 5 min to fuel my car, I spend 40 min and got charged for $100 for nothing. I’m sure once I will call 800 number they will refund my money, but don’t use “Pay for fuel”, you might spend much more time than you expect.",3,,Its nice designed app I would avoid using Pay fuel function I paid using function today pump The pump got activated charged right away using Apply Pay I pump fuel yet hoped kind crazy high preauthorization adjust balance Then pump responding start fueling process allowing select fuel grade nothing else The cancel button got grayed app I able cancel I able get fuel either I called gas station worker able help either since transaction initiated using app dint control Wrokers agree block pump one else use preauthorized pending transaction gave BP number call find refund charge So instead spending min fuel car I spend min got charged nothing Im sure I call number refund money dont use Pay fuel might spend much time expect,negative,0.81,0.14,0.05,"crazy high pre-authorization, fueling process, cancel button, gas station, Apply Pay, pending transaction, 800 BP number, fuel grade, 800 number, nice, function, pump, kind, balance, control, Wrokers, one, $100 charge, 5 min, car, 40 min, time"

Extremely disapointed with this app. Far too many bugs and clearly not ready for launch. A very poor user experience asnd likely last time to use it.

If i cant use it on the app i wont use the app, or will just go to any other servo.  Lastly there are too many steps to log in.

Geo-locate the store you are at, unlock a pump and pay remotely. This app is a 5 star idea; what a shame it is a 1 star execution. First of. all the initial set up is a nightmare. The lack of single signon means you. have to register and validate an email address, set up a pin, and register. a payment method (twice, because PayPal doesn't work). This process alone. almost had me uninstalling the app. However as a motorbike rider the. thought of not having to take off my helmet every time I filled up was. still compelling, so I stuck with it. Unfortunately things just got worse. Even when the app works, it is so slow that you might as well have paid at. the counter. As the only member of a group using this app on a road trip, I. was often still at the pump waiting for the transaction to complete after. my friends had filled up and paid. And that was *if* the app worked. The. last transaction of the 4 I used this app for failed, meaning not only did. I waste the time using the app, but then I was ""that guy"" who held everyone. at the register up while a manual adjustment took place. For an app whose. only feature is convenience, a 25% failure rate is ridiculous. Using this. app is the consumer equivilant of being the monkey shot into space: you'll. be amazed at the technology, you'll be awed at the possibilities, and. you'll probably burn up on re-entry. The only reason to download this app. today is to understand the phrase ""testing in production"".

At least 70% of the time I need to go instore to confirm payments have gone through or it times out or it says no internet connection when there is one. Also be prepared for $1 test payments EVERY time you use the app. Keep hoping the app will improve but seems even buggier. 9/10 times I have to go in to the shop to make sure the app has worked. Can wait up to 5-10 minutes for a receipt to come through.,12,1,2020-11-30 11:51:35,"Thanks for your feedback. The $1 you refer to, whenever you load a payment type into your BPme wallet or use BPme’s Pay for Fuel functionality, a $1 pre autho amount is held & refunded 3-10 days (depends on your bank).This is a card validation & security measure. Notification will appear in BPme app. Further info, you can head to the BPme website.",This app incredibly buggy unreliable At least time I need go instore confirm payment gone time say internet connection one Also prepared test payment EVERY time use app Keep hoping app improve seems even buggier time I go shop make sure app worked Can wait minute receipt come,mixed,0.55,0.02,0.43,"internet connection, 5-10 minutes, $1 test payments, app, time, instore, shop, receipt"

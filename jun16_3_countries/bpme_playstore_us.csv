Now, there is this new app. I've tried to used the app 3 times thus far, and with each attempt, the app tells me that I am not at a BP station, even though I'm sitting at the pump. I have location services enabled, so there is an obvious defect in the program. Unless this is resolved, I will stop using the app. Additionally, even though BP is a convenient station to my home, I'll be filling up at other local stations because this change shows that BP isn't concerned about customer care and customer service.

I can then log on successfully (although this is also pretty slow). Lesson 1: launch the app several minutes before you arrive at the gas station. Second, once I select a pump and a payment method, it takes a very long time to communicate with the backend and activate the pump (assuming it works at all). The last few times I have lost patience waiting for it and just swiped my card!

I have my paypal account linked so i tried to unlink my paypal account & relink it. No go. I could tell it never even hit paypal because i will receive a $1 pre charge from paypal and i didn't even receive that. Sometimes when i have issues i will see the precharge go across but it will tell me it has been denied. I will call paypal and they will tell me its not on their side. If this only happened 1 or 2 it would be understandable but this is a common occurrence. It seem always close to when the app was updated and they messed stuff up and they randomly it will start working again.

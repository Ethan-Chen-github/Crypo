First the app gives static opening times for stations but doesn’t show at a glance which of those on the map are actually open nor anything to alert about closing say in next 30 mins which both of these would be good features. Second, there are no prices shown against the stations on the map. BP should not get carried away thinking users are insensitive to price. No, with much better fuels these days at the discounters BP needs to work harder on being price competitive. The app should show the prices. Finally, a disappointment which I thought was rather cheeky is why does fuel cost more if using the App? Fuel should be less for using the App as one hasn’t had to use staff service at the station.

A couple of times it did appear to be slow to find the garage location, but I wonder if that is more to do with the connectivity from the mobile phone network provider than the actual app?.

So if I had driven off I would have been classed as a drive away my details would have been passed to the Police!. The other issue is that this app could encourage someone to use their phone on a petrol station forecourt which is a complete no go due to the well publicised explosion risk. There are clear instructions on the app but how many people read and head instructions? I checked my linked credit card and it had a total of £400 pre authorised for each of my four tries. So as far as I am concerned this app is a big mistake by BP why not just use a pay at pump system like every other modern petrol retailer it is much safer and in my experience reliable. By the way I am not a technophobe I love technology when it works. If there was a zero star I would have selected this.

It either can’t be launched (poor reception at the petrol station it is advertised at), “can’t find the station” (despite me being IN the petrol station), it has an error halfway through fuelling (leaving me unsure of payment status), or fails to log me in (despite log in credentials being correct, and working fine at home!!). Several times now I have pulled in at a BP and then had to drive away again in frustration because the app won’t work and I don’t have another form of payment on me.

294,2021-05-09 12:00:03,Anthony Asante,False,What’s the Point ?,I have used this app and still does however in the past 5month. It has been painful to pay for fuel as it always fails to authenticate payment of fuel. I have been stranded in areas at time without fuel because for some reason the app fails to authenticate fuel payment. I have tried the following yet without any success;. 1. Deleted and installed the app again. 2. Logged out and logged in again. 3. Deleted payment card and added card again. 4. I have spoken to my bank and no issues with authorisation/failed authorisation. 5. I have contacted BPme team - my experience is that no one seems to know how to resolve this issues. I have been forced now to use another fuel vendor. Would be good to get this app working ok again.

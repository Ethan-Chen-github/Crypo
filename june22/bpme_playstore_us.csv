card for rewards but also keep my credit card so I could pay through the 
app - which is what Cumberland Farms has been able to do for years. Since I 
now live several miles from a Cumberland Farms, but only half a mile from 
BP, I figured I could finally stop having to use two cards every time I 
need gas and actually get done in a reasonable amount of time. But no. I 
downloaded the app, linked my cards and found my usual station... Only to 
go thru the whole process and be told they don't accept mobile payments! 
Perhaps that should have been made clear at the onset! The nearest BP that 
does take mobile payments is over 11 miles away -- meanwhile there's at 
least a dozen BP stations in between me and that station. If I'm not 
driving 3 miles to go to Cumberland Farms, why would I go 11? Very 
disappointed in this app. If you're going to offer this, then either 
preface it with ""in select locations only"" or don't offer it at all. That

However the app tells me now that I can save $0.05 a gallon but yet when I stop to fill up I only have 2 3 cents a gallon. I called customer service service and inconveniently their system was down. However I'm going to have to call him again because I really want that money off eventually it'll be $0.10 off a gallon. And it'll only take $0.03 off each gallon even though I've earned the points.

It is now time to find another rewards program if this flawed app is the only way to receive rewards. This is a followup post to the suggestion that I call customer service. I did and was disconnected three times. Once I was able to speak to someone, then I was transferred to tech support.

When I launch it, and try to pay for fuel, it always asks me to select a payment method when I only have one card loaded, my BP Visa. It then insists that I verify my account information. This process takes too long. Am I doing something wrong? Is something not verified? Also, I have a truck with a 48 gallon tank that takes more then $100 to fill. Why can’t I go beyond a $100 sale? Its my money, please let me decide how much to spend. At times, I do not want to use my reward points (cents off a gallon), how can I only use the reward when I want to?

Quick easy and the rewards stacked up easy to understand. New app is horrible. However I think standing waiting for 2 minutes to activate a pump is unacceptable. Especially in this day and age. Then to have it reset and not save my password? Lost another 40 in rewards since sitting at the pump resetting my password isn't a option. Spent 30 bux and it didn't count towards my rewards.

Since it was converted to app I miss out on points everytime I get gas. I put $50 or more weekly. I was instructed to uninstall and reinstall the app after this last update to see if it helps. All it did was kick out the only payment method I was able to add originally. So now I cant even get points when I pay with the card. I've reached out to BP more than once.

There are so many problems it is just easier to get your credit card out. First of all, whenever I launch and log on, it sits at the ""circling"" cursor for several minutes before eventually timing out and saying there is an error. I can then log on successfully (although this is also pretty slow). Lesson 1: launch the app several minutes before you arrive at the gas station. Second, once I select a pump and a payment method, it takes a very long time to communicate with the backend and activate the pump (assuming it works at all). The last few times I have lost patience waiting for it and just swiped my card! Finally, this morning I tried to use it and it got stuck at the ""select payment"" step, telling me to ""log on"" even though I already had. I signed out and back in again... and my saved BP Visa card had vanished from the payment methods. Net: BP needs to fix all of the technical bugs and general lagginess of this app; but it also needs to do a ground-up redesign of the whole flow of the user interaction.

My paypal and bank card were linked to the Bp app and I never recieved my rewards. Besides that it continues to locate a gas station but never finds or connects to one.

Every time I have tried to use this app it wants me to read emails and get more validation codes. Screw these people. I am not blocking a pump to respond to silly sassed emails. I don't have time to waste with products like this. I will just purchase fuel elsewhere. I won't be using this app in the future as it is about as worthless as they come.

Station finder shows stations that it asks you to use a card instead. Location for 2 stations across the street from each other are wrong. Won't let you manually select a station nearby when it fixes on the wrong station or none at all. If there is a concern about station confusion relabel the pump numbers so they are unique in a given area.

I have been using the app for a couple years now and dealing with the issues since then. If you thinking sitting at the gas station multiple times for 20 or more minutes trying to get the app to work then go ahead and specifically driving to a BP station (there aren't many in my area) to use the app and then it doesn't work. Recently i went to gas up and this is the error i received from the app ""we have a problem unlocking your pump. Please try again or speak to one of our staff"". Yea i tried about 10 times. I have my paypal account linked so i tried to unlink my paypal account & relink it. No go. I could tell it never even hit paypal because i will receive a $1 pre charge from paypal and i didn't even receive that. Sometimes when i have issues i will see the precharge go across but it will tell me it has been denied. I will call paypal and they will tell me its not on their side. If this only happened 1 or 2 it would be understandable but this is a common occurrence. It seem always close to when the app was updated and they messed stuff up and they randomly it will start working again. So if you think this is work going out of your way to maybe safe $.05 a gallon go ahead. For me i'm deleting it and going to try the shell rewards card and hoping the experience is better.

BP has gotten worse & now BP fuel reward program will not allow me access to do anything even after recovering a password & when that had problems or a road block, I created a fresh new account & I still have problems even after the verification process. I think BP has a problem with either my name or phone number because of an older account? It has been truly frustrating using BP me app & fuel rewards program & it has discontinued the card at the pump if one does not have internet or cellular access to get on the network to use the app. Suppose one does not have a phone or data is not available? The current design of this app seems truly discriminatory toward people with disabilities. I recommend using Shell's fuel rewards program as one can still use the card at the pump in case you do not have internet/data access. I did hear that one can use a phone # at the pump with BP but since my account is messed up with them I do not think I can do even this now though it did work prior to or around March 2020. I tried again & I had problems. I do not trust BP's me app at this point due to its many inconveniences at this point.

I hate these kind of apps, but fell victim to the offer of .25 off a gallon and input my phone # at the pump. I was sent a text link with a promo code. After downloading and entering the promo code it was not accepted. I gave up. Maybe it was because I refused to allow BP access to read all my contacts (which should NOT be needed...shame on them!!). I was not told that was required but maybe that was the issue. I'm done.",1,1,,2021-05-24 08:35:03,"Hi Fred, we are sorry to hear about your experience and would love to look into this for you.

8,mr_zayar,False,Love the idea but avoid for now,5,"Using this app on the day of release was fabulous. But thing changed on next week. 

Now because of new changes the pump will stop at £XXX.50. For example if you fill up for £40.00 the pump will stop at £39.50 and It is absolutely fine. Bank hold the £40.00 till BP request. I thought my Barclays will released £39.50 to BP and will return £0.50 to me after 10 days.

However when BP requested for £39.50, which is the correct that I filled up for my car, my Barclays released £39.50 to BP but still holding £40 because thats the amount that i authorised from my phone. No idea when I will see that £40 back in my account hopefully after 10days later.

Please consider the following points before you use this app.

1) You will need £20 to fill up just £10 as Bank will hold up extra £10 for don’t know how long.

2) You make sure to check the pump before you authorised the payment. Because once you authorised bank will hold the money for at least 10 days even pump is not working. If you have extra money for the month this will not be issue but I have. 

love the idea but things are not smooth as I expected yet. BP should work with Apple Pay or Google Pay to avoid this problem.",2017-12-19 23:56:22,

After going through the rigmarole of setting up an account, verifying my email, adding a payment card, adding my nectar card I was all set.

Turns out the app doesn’t remember you or use touch/faceid. I was sat in my car looking at the log in screen. 

As I value my security I take advantage of my phone’s ability to create long unbreakable passwords, and they are all different from each other. A consequence of this is I don’t, from memory, know all my passwords.

The app hasn’t been written to integrate into apples keychain (some do) so I would have had to exit the app, go into settings copy the password and go back into the app to log in. Every single time!

I selected £25.00 on app and fuel pumped stopped at £24.50 so my account was only charged £24.50.
BUT couple days later I noticed on my online banking that there’s a pending amount £25.00, why ? This streamline process isn’t right considering payments were taken immediately from my bank account. For some who pump fuel over £100 weekly that’s a large amount pending overall. Will NOT continue to use app unless they remove streamline process. 
BPme FAQs 👇🏻. 
Why is there a pending amount for BP in my bank statement? 
To streamline the process of paying for fuel, BPme completes a check with your bank to confirm that you have the available funds before authorising the pump. The amount you choose to fill up by (or £100 if you choose to fill your tank) will be reserved from your balance. But don't worry, you will only be charged for the total amount of fuel dispensed.           
The pre-authorised funds will be released by your bank within a few days when the final amount is processed although in certain circumstances this can take up to 10 days.",2018-04-02 11:14:07,

Instead, however, a day later I was then charged £53 pounds! I got straight in touch with Monzo and explained the situation and they (to their credit) refunded me the £100 given it was still in a pending state.

When I enquired with Monzo as to what had happened they explained that BP do one of two things;

1. Charge £100 then amend that amount a day later (whilst it’s still pending)
2. Charge £100 then a day later charge the actual amount (in addition) before refunding the £100 7 DAYS LATER!

Massive mistake that has cost me considerably, as others state it takes around 5 mins to load the app which is pointless at the pump, quicker going in.

Several direct debits have now bounced due to lack of funds and no where on the app to get it resolved.

My advice unless you want £100 frozen out your account for a week (explained again in QA) then do not download!! Shell all the way regardless

Update 29/4 - Barclays have responded stating BP have placed a hold on the funds for 7 days and they are unable to release them as the transaction is guaranteed with a debit card, BP are blaming the bank and despite their own T&Cs stating the hold will be lifted once the transaction goes through I still have no money",2018-04-30 11:38:08,"{'id': 3758828, 'body': ""Hi there.

This app also has a 50p buffer which only allows you to put £4.50 of fuel if you want £5.00. The full fiver leaves your account for it to come back within a period of time which the app lacks to tell you. The app is also pointless. It’s only been useful to get the 500 extra points on my nectar card for a one time use. Also the nectar points don’t refresh like the nectar app does.

147,LondonTownBaby,False,Awful. App error had store put me as a drive off & accused me of not paying,1,"I used the BPme app to fill up fuel in my car. I followed the app instructions and got the confirmation it was ready to fuel and good to go. It stated my email confirmation will be emailed.  

However, I shortly got accused an hour later, around the corner, that I had driven off without paying for fuel. When I advised the member of staff I had paid via the app and took it out to show him, I was presented an error message that stated an error occurred and I should ‘try again’ or ‘call us’. 

At no point in your FAQ’s or instructions of how the app works, does it state I should go into the app after fuelling to ensure the transaction has gone through. If there is an error, the app should not unlock the pump and advise I am ready to go and will receive an email later. The error message should come through as a notification to my phone, nor should I be allowed to proceed if there is this risk. 

It is extremely unacceptable to be accused of theft and to be told I would have been reported to the police as a drive off, due to your app’s incompetence. If your app is not robust to complete transactions accurately or notify an individual timely of errors then it should not be in use. 

This experience has been completely unsettling and I want to ensure everyone is made aware to steer clear of this app.",2018-05-22 19:59:49,"{'id': 4060011, 'body': ""Hi there.

151,Intelligent Reviews,False,Insufficient info,2,"There are two problems as far as I’m concerned. First the app gives static opening times for stations but doesn’t show at a glance which of those on the map are actually open nor anything to alert about closing say in next 30 mins which both of these would be good features.

Second, there are no prices shown against the stations on the map. BP should not get carried away thinking users are insensitive to price. No, with much better fuels these days at the discounters BP needs to work harder on being price competitive. The app should show the prices.

Finally, a disappointment which I thought was rather cheeky is why does fuel cost more if using the App? Fuel should be less for using the App as one hasn’t had to use staff service at the station.

These are three ways BPMe could be improved. BP shouldn’t believe that loyalty is assured just because of the App because it isn’t.

I have 3 occasions when the app would not function properly and I had to pay by credit card in the shop. One one occasion the pump would not unlock. On two occasions, after an app update I think, I could not get access for a while. Today I can still not get access.
When I start the app I am asked for my pin. Well I was using Face ID on my iPhone X so I don’t know what pin was being asked for. I tried a few pins, but they all failed. It seemed like I could make as many attempts as I like - surely a security risk.
There is a Forgot Pin option, which is badly positioned on the iPhone X making only just possibly to touch.
I did this, got the link on my email, reset my pin and tried again in the app. No luck. Tried this several times more and the new Pin was not recognised.

The biggest benefit to me as a driver, is the convenience of paying from your car, especially when you are at a busy garage and in a hurry. The BPme app has definitely saved me time at my fuel stops. 

I was unable to use BPme on one occasion when the search could not find my location. I received a polite message on the screen to advise BPme was not available at that garage yet, no big deal to me.

A couple of times it did appear to be slow to find the garage location, but I wonder if that is more to do with the connectivity from the mobile phone network provider than the actual app?
 
As another reviewer commented, it is of significant benefit when you have babies / children with you as it saves either the decision to leave them in the car, or the hassle of having to take them with you to pay.
 
Amusingly, I have received strange looks from people on a couple of occasions, who I can only assume think I am driving off without paying!

An absolute pain as this means I have had to update cad details with loads of retailers etc. 

It is only a few days later that through google I have found that BP app uses PayPal for their card services, so this PayPal £0 transaction was probably BP verifying card details entered in the app.

Deleted card and re-input making absolutely sure expiry correct. Again security checks accepted - but app still shows wrong expiry!

Then put in Nectar, accepted. Closed app and reopened - Nectar no longer linked!

Checked other feedback and see some garages decline after filled up as not using app despite being on app as accepting! So it seems you need to go in first, join the queue, find if accepted, then fill up if you want to collect the £10 Amex reward.

Only reason I got the app was due to an Amex deal where you get £10 back for using the app. Seems to me a scam to get people filling up at BP garage and then not give the £10 back as the app fails

On one occasion app suggested payment was successful. I checked with the pump attendant who explained the app was rubbish and my payment had not registered. So if I had driven off I would have been classed as a drive away my details would have been passed to the Police!
The other issue is that this app could encourage someone to use their phone on a petrol station forecourt which is a complete no go due to the well publicised explosion risk. There are clear instructions on the app but how many people read and head instructions? I checked my linked credit card and it had a total of £400 pre authorised for each of my four tries. 
So as far as I am concerned this app is a big mistake by BP why not just use a pay at pump system like every other modern petrol retailer it is much safer and in my experience reliable. By the way I am not a technophobe I love technology when it works. If there was a zero star I would have selected this.

Yeah right. So I'm a beta tester and you trick me with a discount I can't get. Utterly unimpressed. I'm considering getting Amex to pull its offer as it's basically fraud. I was made to give BP money under false pretences. 

I can buy fuel cheaper elsewhere and so all you're offering is convince with an app that doesn't work, so it's not. I would pay more to avoid queuing, but this app can't be trusted to give any benefits. 

I'd avoid it as it's an empty promise.

Update: tried three times to fill at BP. Tried different limits on the fill in the app. Every single one failed and the Amex offer won't pay out. So as far as I'm concerned it's all a total con and a waste of time. Uninstalled.

I then had to authorise it my banking app (not the BP apps fault, but frustrating), which then declined it! (Again making an already frustrating, experience more frustrating, again not necessarily BP’s fault). At this point I gave up and went to pay at the night window.

- usage is still really unclear whether I can put petrol in before I pay or have to mess around on the app before I fill up
- the £100 auth thing is a joke. Either let me set the amount by default or auth the actual amount used (this might not be possible if you have to auth before you fill up, which is a stupid design if so)

I didn’t realise you could link a bank card and pay with it in your car. I only got it after verbalising my annoyance at them discontinuing Nectar! My fuel points on my Nectar card pays for my Christmas dinner from Sainsbury’s each year so I was very unimpressed indeed. 
I said I’d be buying fuel in Tesco and getting Clubcard points for Christmas dinner shopping there instead. After he told me I could use this new card for free fuel I gave in and took one but having read the reviews here I’m even more unhappy. I am not having £100 frozen in my account to fill up which is only £60. I’m not risking being stopped round the corner for non payment, and I’m not sitting there waiting for my phone to realise which BP I’m at, as I could of popped in and paid by the time it did that.

Got a card, downloaded the app. QR code didn’t work, as it took me to a site that had a failed proxy error. 

Clunky, convoluted, time consuming way to sign up- including two separate emails to verify who I was - for a damned rewards card. Jeez- I am now getting sick of this and I haven’t even started using it yet. 

Eventually the temporary physical card is linked to my app. Yes, the app- because I really need another app on my phone. Like I need an enema. 

So now I have an app, that wants my bank card details, and has no way to find out anywhere ANY value to having this app.

Yes, having gone through the entire process I can’t find anything, nowhere that tells me what I can do with the “rewards”

Yes, there is a button to redeem rewards- which pushes you out of the app (so yet again the app has no purpose) and goes to a website - that fails to load. And if I look on a PC on the BP Me website there seems to be no information on how to redeem, or on what. What is the point?

So I now have an app that wants my bank card, and can do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for me. Why don’t I just sign up a direct debit and you can take money randomly from me?

Someone in BP clearly spent a lot of time trying to work out how to retain customer loyalty, and I get the concept. 

It’s just this app, and the entire process of setting up, paying, collecting and (hopefully somehow) redeeming, is utterly incompetent and does nothing but annoys me. 

I might genuinely stop using BP because of this app. Is is totally counter-productive to what they are trying to achieve.

This app now works very well, and is my preferred payment method, although seeing at the Collaboration with the M&S food courts are so good, I often go into the store to buy a few items and pay for the fuel and shopping together. It’s here that the app has its second usage as it doubles up as a loyalty card and it doesn’t take long for the savings and offers to build it. 

It might have taken a few issues to get it working well, but BP you have nailed it now.

Brilliant.

I thought I’d try it out at my local brand new, super  hi-tech BP/M&S station on the A143 just outside Diss.
Didn’t work!
The app recognised the fuel station via gps, recognised the entered pump number and the “fill tank” option only to fail at the “unlocking pump” stage
So, cancelled the attempt and fuelled/payed as normal.
The girl at the checkout said that this was pretty much standard, due apparently to “poor signal” She said that most customers have said the app is more suited to inner city use (?!&£)

I have tried the following yet without any success;
1. Deleted and installed the app again
2. Logged out and logged in again
 3. Deleted payment card and added card again
4. I have spoken to my bank and no issues with authorisation/failed authorisation
5. I have contacted BPme team - my experience is that no one seems to know how to resolve this issues. 

I have been forced now to use another fuel vendor.

It works but it's loaded with bugs. I registered using PayPal, this went ok. First issue experienced was with the SMS verification - I could enter the code but there was no button to press to submit it. The enter key on they keyboard was non functional, only requesting the code be re-sent presented the 'verify' button. I did not use the 'find a store' feature as the map was not centralised on my general location (or Australia for that matter lol), I just searched for the store I was at when there. Being available I was able the select a pump and have it unlocked when I submitted the request. Filled the car and returned to it, checked the status of the app the see an 'unknown error' pop-up. The app returned the original screen asking what I wanted to do. I was unsure of whether or not I would be chased down for non payment (and secretly was hoping I got a free tank for my testing!) until a PayPal email a minute or so later confirmed my purchase. It has the potential but needs a much larger and extended pilot group to iron out these issues BEFORE being published.

It now loads much faster and starts looking for my location successfully.  The app works well, but it looks like there is still a lot of manual interaction from the shop assistant with respect to releasing the pump on BPme's say-so, and then acknowledging that you've finished with the pump before BPme bills you.  I've waited several minutes between hanging up the pump and for the app to confirm I've paid, which can be longer than just walking into the shop and paying the traditional way. No doubt this situation will change over time when BPme is trusted to do it all automatically.  I think overall the concept is great, and no one else has anything like it. Thumbs up and looking forward to future updates!  EDIT Feb 2018: The latest update has brought back the forever-spinning-circle on load again. Even worse is that when I lock my phone and then unlock it to provoke the PIN number, it now tells me that my PIN is wrong! I can reset it via the emailed link which allows me in that one time, but then when I next fill up, it tells me that PIN is wrong again!!

If i cant use it on the app i wont use the app, or will just go to any other servo.  Lastly there are too many steps to log in.

internet connected, GPS enabled phone, this app was what they were talking 
about. Geo-locate the store you are at, unlock a pump and pay remotely. 
This app is a 5 star idea; what a shame it is a 1 star execution. First of 
all the initial set up is a nightmare. The lack of single signon means you 
have to register and validate an email address, set up a pin, and register 
a payment method (twice, because PayPal doesn't work). This process alone 
almost had me uninstalling the app. However as a motorbike rider the 
thought of not having to take off my helmet every time I filled up was 
still compelling, so I stuck with it. Unfortunately things just got worse. 
Even when the app works, it is so slow that you might as well have paid at 
the counter. As the only member of a group using this app on a road trip, I 
was often still at the pump waiting for the transaction to complete after 
my friends had filled up and paid. And that was *if* the app worked. The 
last transaction of the 4 I used this app for failed, meaning not only did 
I waste the time using the app, but then I was ""that guy"" who held everyone 
at the register up while a manual adjustment took place. For an app whose 
only feature is convenience, a 25% failure rate is ridiculous. Using this 
app is the consumer equivilant of being the monkey shot into space: you'll 
be amazed at the technology, you'll be awed at the possibilities, and 
you'll probably burn up on re-entry. The only reason to download this app 
today is to understand the phrase ""testing in production"". Otherwise come 
back in 2 years when the bugs have been resolved.",1,0,,2018-05-07 06:59:44,,

Before fueling up I started app and locked the fuel pump. All good at this stage. It told me to fill up now but in both cases once done I had to go inside since the app was stuck in progressing state. Basically the person in the service station had to re-adjust the price between the bpme system and their pump. So it took me much longer than the normal way. For me this app is just not working. I think this is a classic case of developing an app for the sake of having an app. Why didn't you install pay & wave on the pump directly ? Just fill up wave your phone or card against the pump and you are done. For me the whole app BPME app concept is over-engineerd and over-thought. Please go back to the whiteboard and rethink.

The app should allow you to be able to cancel a pump/re-select a pump if 
you have selected the wrong pump. Believe it or not, it's quiet easy to get 
the number wrong since you have to make the selection in your car. The 
chances of you getting it wrong are increased. Since I couldn't change the 
pump, I had to pay for someone else's fuel And getting a refund was a 
mission. The staff are not even aware of how the BPme app works. Issue #2 
Sometimes the app loses connection half way through the process then it 
declines the transaction and you find out after driving off. You get a 
nasty $3 extra to the bill. Issue #3 You pay an extra $1-$3 for each 
transaction. Noticed this when I had to go in and check. Their system 
showed $86.54 I was charge $89.54 through PayPal. Maybe it's them covering 
the costs of using PayPal as the payment process. Suggestions You should be 
able to link this with the virgin frequent flyer scheme. I'm losing out on 
a lot of points as I only fill up here because of that reason. Have a 
fingerprint access so that login can be sped up a little bit. Or just speed 
up the processing for the app. If you can fix this, the app would be very

I tested this app at home first .There is a nice tutorial on their site as to how to use the app. What it doesn't show is how slow it is to type the password and the 5 minutes of waiting for the app to respond after entering the correct password . 2 attempts later and finally I'm in , it asks me a question , I give the correct answer and a message comes up that I'm suspended. This whole process took just under 10 minutes to finally end up suspended. I'M sooo glad I wasn't at the pump trying to do this. I will UNINSTALL and possibly try again in a year. Update Apr 2020 I Just read latest reviews , BP replies don't even address the other users concerns and seem to assume they are setup to use the app when clearly they are not !!! come on just READ the peoples concerns before replying .I'm going to give it a bit more time before re-trying this app.",1,4,1.41.0,2020-04-15 06:57:01,"Hi Mic Watz,

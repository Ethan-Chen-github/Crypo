It would also be really useful to see a price spread between locations that are nearby.

Note that when creating an account we are asked to provide email address, First name, last name, and zip code. Why should I have to provide all this upon first opening the app, can't this be obtained easily from entering credit card info?

Lastly, the button shown to customer ""Fill up today to start earning rewards"" spins with a loading message when clicked and then goes back to default message- no idea what purpose this serves other than to think it is broken.

I was promised a $.25 bonus for trying the app but when I attempted to use it at the station in my neighborhood I learned that it did not work there. In fact the closest station was 35 miles away so I made the trek only to pay an additional $.30 per gallon above my local stations price. At least I was able to experience the potential convenience the app could offer. 

After my purchase I received an email congratulating me on using the app and earning the $.25 bonus. When I didn’t see the bonus reflected in my balance I contacted customer support. After 4 unanswered inquiries I was disappointed to learn that BP decided to cancel the bonus they congratulated me for earning because they deemed my purchase insufficient to remit the bonus. 

Sadly I will no longer purchase my fuel at BP after I use my rewards balance and instead of sharing the benefits of the app’s safety (the BP station I frequent at the entrance to my community was recently found to have card readers that steal your credit card info which made me eager to share the app as an option at my next community meeting) and convenience I’ll be sharing my dissatisfaction with my network.

1. The labels on all the gas pumps were either faded or peeling, making it difficult to identify which pump I was using, which is necessary for app use. 
2. There is no price incentive for using the app. You still pay the credit price. I find this to be odd, but I suppose it’s intentional.

Pros 
Keeps all your receipts
Easy payment system
You get rewards
You can see your nearest gas stations

Cons 
It’s the biggest one and makes the app 
Useless.

(Doesn’t save you any money.)
————————————————

Did the app work yes haven’t had a problem 
But the point of the app is so that your loyal customer that took there time to download your app save some money with the rewards and use your app.

This doesn’t happen and some simple math can show this.

Gas prices                                         Debt
Cash2.999  x 17 gallons = 50.983 < Dcard in app
Credit 3.099 x 17gallons = 52.683 <<App same Debit card

I paid more in the app $1.70 more if I used my card.    1.70-0.5=1.65

I really wish someone would actually think this through.The first few times the app conveniently lost my log in so I had to change my password. Now I’m always getting an error that my card was declined. Mind you, I have used this on the day I got paid so I clearly had more then enough money in my account. So there are bank connection issues as well. Either that or Chase bank is smart and doesn’t want to work with the app. Great concept but overall they need to bring back the physical card they had before. I spend more time at the pump trying to get the app to work then I do when I just swipe my card. And trying to submit anything through customer service is a joke.

Had added one previously and worked, now trying to add another it keeps going into “Problem adding card” loop. Tried multiple cards. Erased and redownloaded app, erased previous card etc to no avail. Also login is a pain and requires too many steps repeatedly. The imei from the phone and pin you chose should be enough. Just wasted 30 minutes at the pump and also met a family member there because the app was too complicated for them to use. All because we wanted to use the Amex offer we had for this “app”.

Tired of these giant companies bloating technology and releasing crap into the market. You’ll also notice these issues have been ongoing and this app is littered with 1-star reviews, yet the App Store shows a 5-star rating. Always read reviews sorted by “most recent first”. That way you can see the real reviews before the Tech-world deletes them or covers them up. Entities should be held accountable for all this EPIDEMIC manipulation. Now will probably get a canned reply from the developer saying,” Looks like a technical issue, call this number.” No thanks, not going to fall for your fake sincerity and concern and waste even more time calling even more clueless “customer service” reps. If your company is so concerned, send out some gift cards for wasting everybody's time, or at least some form of genuine accountability.

The App looks like it might be nice; however I could not get into the app because of the very light font on a white background. For this of us with vision issues, color clubs was, etc., this app is a waste of time. 

Someone in BPs design department must have thought this was a clever idea to make the app look “modern”. In fact, this “cleverness” just cost the company a new customer, wasted marketing money and made me seriously consider selling my BP stock if this is the kind of cutting edge “wisdom” guiding their fight to remain relevant. Did anyone review this with any test group of users?!?! 

I called the 800 support to register my issue and was told - I could just link my card to the app. I don’t have a card. I was going to be a new addition, a new customer, using a promotion that BP spent money on to capture me. That was all wasted. Brilliant thinking BP! Thank your app developers for losing this potential customer before I was even able to get in the door. 

I gave this a 1 star because 0 was not an option.

First I was a member of the older BP Driver Rewards program, so I tried using my old login but that failed. Fine, I’ll re-register and forgive that I may have lost some reward credit from the old program. As I register, I need to give the account a password, I just tried to use the same password from the old program; turns out I could not use it because somehow the system remembered my old password for what was supposed to be a new registration. A bit annoying, not so bad to be one star.

When I register, I enter a promo code, which was accepted, but when I check the app, it just shows the regular $0.05 discount for no code. Annoying, but not one star annoying, and it’s a marketing thing, not the app per se. 

I do all that before I get to the gas station, so that I don’t waste time at the pump. I get to the gas station and try to use it. The pump doesn’t say much about how to proceed, so I just open the app. I click on the button to pay for fuel. The app cannot find my location. I check my settings. Location services are on. I check the BPme app, location services are on when using the app. I go back to the app, it still cannot find my location. I go to Station Finder, the app locks up. I kill the app and restart it, it is stuck on the splash screen (ie. the starting BPme logo screen) and won’t start. I have the latest iPhone Pro Max, for crying out loud! So far I have wasted minutes at a busy gas station trying to get this dump app to work! Now we are a one-star-land.

I decide to restart the phone. That takes a while. I get to the app, it starts. I go to pay for fuel, location is working now and I pick my pump number. I go to pay using Apple Pay, the app starts spinning and locks up again. Then says there’s an error processing payment. By now the gas station attendant is literally yelling at me over the speaker on the pump asking what is the problem. I respond and he yells the same question again. I guess he doesn’t hear me. I shake the phone so he can see it and point at it and say again that the app is not working. So I’m trying to pay, getting yelled at, looking at the BPme display fine print that I am expected to pay $0.99 a month to subscribe to this terrible experience. I’m thinking about how so many startups with far smaller revenue than BP churn out much better performing apps all day, every day. I just take out my credit card and pay the old fashioned way, and now have to figure out how to de-register because I am not paying a subscription for this.

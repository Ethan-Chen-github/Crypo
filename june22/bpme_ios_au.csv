After sitting in my car, waiting for the app to find my location and then selecting the pump number, it took about another minute before the pump was actually unlocked and the app to tell to commence filling up my car. 

Once I had finished refuelling, I return the fuel hose and jumped into my car. Here the screen was still stuck on a loading screen. Waiting for the next screen to pop up confirming that the transaction had been paid for. 

This screen took another couple minutes just sitting there. So I sat in my car again. Not wanting to drive away not paying for fuel. 

Frustrated, I went into the shop and told the attendant my issue, that I’m not sure if I’ve paid yet and that if he can confirm. 

The response I was greeted with was deplorable. Absolutely rude. “You’re using the app. I don’t know why you came in for. You’re wasting your time and my time now. Just go” 

Angrily, I just left immediately. Disgusted. 

Only till I drove down the road away from the fuel station, the screen changed and showed a payment confirmation screen. 

There needs to be some confidence in this system, as I don’t want to have the police called to my house down the track for doing a runner. 

Endless amounts of time are just spent waiting in the car, instead of just going into the shop. 

People behind me in the queue waiting to fill up are getting angry, that I’m just sitting here doing nothing in my car.

82,True,--000--000--,"Absolute garbage app.

Two tries both terrible experience.  Need to fiddle around with setting up BEFORE even starting to fill.  Not good when there are a dozen cars waiting behind you.  (Im not talking about the one time registration which goes without saying needs to be completed, I’m talking about the need to connect to the station, choose a pump and wait for the start filling prompt before you can get started and this all happens slow) Then when done the app doesn’t switch from the fill now prompt, to payment processing.  Have to go inside and have them manually acknowledge the purchase before it will continue.  Also no Velocity points using the app.

Even if it was capable of processing a purchase without needing to go inside, it is not a time saver by the time you go through pre-fill setup, fill and then process payment.  Driving in and needing to setup a pump connection and wait for the you can now fill, then when done going back to the app a second time and spending the same time again to process the payment doesn’t cut it.

The expectation, especially if it is going to save any time, is you drive in fill up then open the app choose the pump and process the outstanding balance.

As mentioned, in my experience, every visit has also required going in, getting in the queue and having them fiddle around on the computer to get the payment to start processing in the app.","{'id': 2109087, 'body': ""Hi --000--000--, we're sorry to hear you had this experience and thank you for letting us know.

Tip:
Have the app running as you’re driving to the station. Then it has “located” the station by the time you drive up to it.

564,False,Someone0192,"Updated the review since I was able to successfully pay for my petrol. 

There is a lot of anxious waiting when using this app:
- waiting to login and be able to select a pump
- once the pump is selected, there is a longer waiting time for the pump to be “unlocked”
- after filling up, the longest wait was for the transaction to take place, which is the worst wait of all since 1) there is no other button/option to press so you’re just hoping your payment goes through, and 2) people are still unused to just getting straight into their cars without paying for petrol first. 

Similar to my initial sentiment, I would prefer to just pay for petrol the old-fashioned way than to use this app, unless I choose to remain in the car with the kids, eg thunderstorms. On a hot day I would probably take them out with me rather than to sit in the car that I cannot run the ignition on as I’ll be using the phone. 

Having said this, I’ll still keep an eye for future improvements as it does have potential. Thank you.

Original review:
I, too, had high hopes for this app as it would potentially allow me to pay for petrol without having to take my kids out of the car, but testing it out by myself I could not get it to work; specifically it would give me a “technical error” when selecting a pump and ask me to try again, but it never worked so I ended up walking in to pay. 
I would like to echo other people’s experiences that it just takes too long with the engine off before you can even fill up (when it works, that is) so, until that is remediated, again I would not be considering using this with children in the car.
I look forward to trying out the next version; hopefully BP will keep investing in this app.",,"When it works, it requires a lot of waiting in the car",2,2019-02-01 12:20:35

My only query would be why the station is allowed to exclude pumps from the app choice. Eg At my local BP I cannot choose pump 3 which is the cheapest fuel, I have to choose one of the other pumps with the more expensive fuel.

Something I think would be great would be if you could use the app to pay for fuel even if you aren’t at the service station, in an emergency for a family member for example.  Also it would be nice if you could see that you can’t use the app before pulling up to the pump, sometimes I’ve bypassed a less expensive choice only to get to the BP and not be able to use the app

All in all I love it, my local is quite slow at activating the pump and processing the payment but it still beats unbuckling a sleeping baby!

Edit a week later: 
I attempted to do the login rigmarole again. Apparently I now have an account, despite never being able to verify it last week. I now can’t remember the password I wanted to set, and now there is no way to reset said password without being able to remember the old one. If I could remember it, I wouldn’t need to reset it now would I?! 

Without my account properly set up, I also can’t set up a PIN for the app, meaning my bank details are unsecured.

It works perfectly fine if the pump can only be accessed from one side, so when your car is parked your pump is yours to use. But when the pump can be accessed from either side here comes the problem. I have just unlocked the pump in the car and about to fill up, the pump was lifted up by another customer from the opposite side.

I went to the cashier and ask to cancel the BP me Payment straight away, but they can’t even see the transaction on the screen. There is no cancel option on the APP once it s unlocked and pump is lifted up. I ended up paying for somebody else who don’t have cash to pay me back and don’t have card to withdraw cash. What made it worst the cashier can’t treat it as cash out either. End up the person was understanding and nice and agreed to pay me through bank transfer.

I removed the filters and they still did not display.  App REQUIRES device’s ‘Location Services’ to be ON in order to complete registration which I do not like- I would prefer to be able to register without Location Services, and then just manually enter a town name, or only activate Location Services manually for search if I was looking for a servo in an unfamiliar region where I didn’t know town name/s to enter.

Even more frustratingly than saying nothing at all, the app teases “Closing Soon” for some service stations - indicating that data on opening hours is buried somewhere in the system, but just kept secret from potential customers for some unimaginable reason.  “Closing Soon” does not help when you’re trying to figure out whether to drive to a service station or not! Will it be closed in an hour? In 5 minutes? This app doesn’t tell you.

Other information is also out of date / inconsistent. App shows a BP station being “Open now” near my house, despite that service station having been demolished for redevelopment several months ago. Admittedly there is a note within the “Location” (street address) for that service station which says it is “temporarily closed” but this just adds to the confusion; on a single screen, I can see that particular service station being noted as “Open now” AND “temporarily closed” AND “24 hours”?!

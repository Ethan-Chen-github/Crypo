The driver of the car queuing behind is hooting as s/he can see someone in the driver's seat using their phone and not moving their car out of the way of the pump! It would make a good comedy sketch as an argument ensues. Perhaps BP needs to rethink this app. I dowloaded it on Android and set the pin etc., I then try the tutorial so when I come to use it I don't hold people up as I can't move my car until I have paid.  The tutorial tells me to do exactly what I have already done but no mention of how to add a card, which presumably you can do and don't have to enter the details each time. Maybe it never got to that stage as it then asked me to download the app, although I was actually using the app! How weird. It also located me in the U.S.  Now I know that BP is U.S. centric but I find it annoying when app creators think that everyone lives in the U.S. There is a big world out there which BP should know about. I change the location to the U.K as the app isn't able to do it automatically despite having GPS on. I then loose everything I have entered and have to start all over again.  By this stage I am angry and uninstall the app.  There could not have been any meticulous trialling outside the compilers themselves. Anyone who knows anything about technology hardwear or softwear trialling knows it has to be tested by those who are NOT familiar with the product, who are not IT specialists and who come to it completely objectively, otherwise it is not a valid trial. BP expects its customers to do the trialling for free and suffer the consequences by the sound of the reviews. The busy working public shouldn't have to do their job.  Even at a busy service station I can pay by card more quickly than with this poorly tested and ill-designed app and I can buy a coffee, which the app will never be able to do.",1,2,1.19.0,2018-04-06 04:51:10,"Hi, is it working now with the latest update?

will be released as soon as it clears. I tried that. It's lies I selected 
£40 to which it filled £39.50 on April 3rd, the £39.50 cleared and showed 
on my statement on April 4th. The £40 Is still pending and today is April 
8th. I needed fuel again yesterday so just went in and paid because I can't 
have previous fuel payments still pending on my account when I need fuel

I set the app to dispense £30 but it stopped at £29 and refused to dispense any more. The app receipt shows £29 but the charge to my card shows £30?!! Other than that the app is slow to initialise at the pump so unless there was a big queue at the till I doubt I'll use the app again. [Edit] Still intent on getting the £10 Amex offer I tried again and this time set the required amount at £31. The pump slowed the dispense rate towards the end and stopped at exactly £30. This under-dispensing is supposedly to stop more than requested being dispensed but if it can consistently stop at exactly £1 less than requested why can't it stop at exactly the amount requested??,1,26,1.38.1,2018-12-13 15:41:02,"Hi Mick.

I'm not sure if I have to actually go in-store to be eligible for the 'swipe to win' prizes but if you do that's defeating the whole purpose of the app. I only gave 4* because it always locks my pump before the '50p' mark as stated.

Good news is you don't need to go into store to take part in swipe to win. If you buy fuel using the BPme app, you're automatically entered. Have a look at the points you earned on your transaction to see if you won more! And the 50p cut off is on purpose, to stop us giving more fuel than you've paid for. ^DS",2020-09-28 20:35:34
